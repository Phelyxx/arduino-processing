# Visual Control Panel for Plant Monitoring in a Nursery
In this project a visual control panel was implemented to monitor the status of two groups of plants in a nursery. Arduino and Processing systems were used, and communication between them was achieved despite the fact that they did not have the same structure and there was no defined API for the connection. In addition, skills were developed for the creation of graphical interfaces. The control panel indicates which group of plants has problems with some environmental variable. To achieve this, Arduino and Processing were initially configured, messages were sent between them, the graphical interface of the control panel was created and the code was executed.
